PROMETHEUS LICENSE
Copyright (c) 2025 Elias Oelschner
https://github.com/prometheus-lua/Prometheus

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

  1. Retained Notice.
     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
     in all copies or substantial portions of the Software that are distributed
     in source or object form, unless explicitly stated otherwise in this
     license.

  2. Attribution Requirement.
     Any Product or Service that (a) includes, links to, wraps, depends on,
     is derived from, uses, or otherwise incorporates the Software (including
     via modification, obfuscation, binary linking, packaging, or embedding),
     whether distributed, provided for use, or made available over a network
     (collectively, "Using Products/Services"), must provide clear,
     reasonably prominent attribution to Prometheus as follows:

       "Based on Prometheus by Elias Oelschner, https://github.com/prometheus-lua/Prometheus"

     This attribution must appear in at least one of the following locations,
     as applicable and reasonably prominent for the type of Using Product/Service:

       a) In-user interface: a visible "About", "Credits", or equivalent screen
          within the product's primary user interface (graphical or web UI).
       b) On the product web site: a visible place such as a footer, About page,
          or documentation landing page that is accessible to the product's users.
       c) In the tool itself: the program's --version, --help output, or similar
          command-line/displayed metadata for CLI tools.
       d) Documentation: in user or developer documentation, README, or product
          manual that accompanies the product.

     For Software provided as a Network Service or SaaS (i.e., made available
     for use over a network rather than distributed as a copy), the attribution
     must be visible on the public-facing web UI (for example on the login
     screen, footer, About page, or a help/credits page accessible without an
     account), and must include the exact phrase above and the URL.

  3. Derivative Statement.
     Any derivative work, modification, fork, or reimplementation of the
     Software that is publicly distributed, publicly hosted, or provided as a
     service must include a prominent statement in its README (or equivalent
     public-facing documentation) that it is based on Prometheus and include the
     exact attribution text in section 2.

  4. Generated Output Exception.
     Files or artifacts produced by running or using the Software (for example,
     obfuscated output files, compiled artifacts, transformed source files,
     or other generated outputs) are NOT required by this license to carry
     copyright notices or license text. The attribution obligations in section 2
     continue to apply to the Using Product/Service that produces, distributes,
     or serves those outputs.

  5. No Trademark License.
     This license does not grant any rights to use the trade names, trademarks,
     service marks, or product names of the Licensor except as required for the
     textual attribution specified in section 2.

  6. Compliance and Termination.
     Any failure to comply with the obligations in sections 2 or 3 will
     terminate the rights granted under this license for the non-compliant
     party with respect to the Software. Rights may be reinstated if the
     non-compliant party cures the breach within thirty (30) days after
     receiving written notice from the Licensor and provides reasonable proof
     of cure.

  7. Sublicensing.
     You may sublicense the Software, provided that any sublicensee is bound
     by the terms of this license and the attribution obligations described
     herein.

  8. Warranty Disclaimer.
     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
     IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
     CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
     TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
     SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

  9. Limitation of Liability.
     IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY
     WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
     OF SUCH DAMAGE.

  10. Governing Law.
     This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
     laws of the jurisdiction chosen by the Licensor. This clause does not
     limit any mandatory consumer protections that may apply in certain
     jurisdictions.

By exercising any rights granted to you under this License, you accept and
agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License.
